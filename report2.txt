=== Pain Points ===

Here are the main pain points mentioned by users in the thread:

• **Rate limiting**: Many users struggle with rate limiting on various websites, which makes it difficult for them to download content in a smooth flow.
Example quote: "I swear, recently its been ridiculous, I download some from yt, until i hit the limit, then i move to flickr and queue up a few downloads. then i get 429."

• **Difficulty with downloading from specific sites**: Users experience issues when trying to download content from certain websites, such as YouTube or Instagram.
Example quote: "Repeat with insta, ig, twitter, discord, weibo, or whatever other site i want to archive from."

• **Inability to stay in a rhythm**: Many users feel frustrated because they can't maintain a steady flow of downloads due to rate limiting or other issues.
Example quote: "Anyone else feel like it's a bit impossible to get into a rhythm?"

• **Difficulty with downloading from YouTube specifically**: Users struggle with downloading content from YouTube, including the recent DRM-related issues.
Example quote: "I was using the github search function to get lists of some open source software, no crawler or anything just manual searching, and they’d let me search maybe three or four things before I got rate limited. Insane."

• **Security concerns**: Users are concerned about the potential risks of downloading content from websites that use AI-powered scraping tools.
Example quote: "Luckily I only have the occasional issue so far. My flow hasn't been messed with yet but I need to clamp down on security since the US is considering making it so much harder."

• **Inability to find reliable software**: Users are struggling to find reliable software that can handle rate limiting and other issues.
Example quote: "Best to just use smarter software that will handle waiting and queueing things for you. For youtube I personally use TubeArchivist. It has its issues, but I can easily archive whole channels with couple of clicks."

• **Difficulty with individual video downloads**: Some users experience issues when trying to download individual videos, rather than entire channels or playlists.
Example quote: "I tend to do quite a bit of individual videos, and it doesn't work so well for that."
