=== Pain Points ===

Here are the main pain points extracted from the conversation thread:

• **Profiteering and unfair market practices**: Users feel that Coinbase is prioritizing profits over fairness, allowing prices to fluctuate in a way that benefits them at the expense of users (e.g., "blatant profiteering", "makes me sick").

• **Unfair trading restrictions**: Users experience difficulties trading during important buying opportunities or feel that their trades are being unfairly restricted (e.g., "refusal to allow people to trade during important buying opportunities", "I got three rejected limit orders").

• **Security concerns and lack of transparency**: Users express concerns about the security of their accounts, feeling that Coinbase is not providing adequate protection (e.g., "Have you ever had to deal with their customer service?... They will repeat to you for over an hour that they 'hear you and understand' but will do absolutely nothing to help you").

• **Misleading or outdated information**: Users feel that Coinbase provides misleading or outdated information, such as delayed delisting notices (e.g., "They won't notify on the dashboard when a stock will be delisted... Their data of delisting is absurdly outdated always").

• **High fees and unfavorable spreads**: Users experience frustration with high fees and unfavorable spreads, which they feel are not justified by market conditions (e.g., "I don't get it. I am new to this... Who gets the extra 1.00?").

• **Lack of trust in Coinbase's business practices**: Users express distrust in Coinbase's business practices, feeling that they prioritize their own interests over those of users (e.g., "Coinbase has business practices that are good for them and not for their customers?!").

• **Difficulty with account management**: Users experience difficulties with managing their accounts, including issues with transfers, withdrawals, or access to information (e.g., "I was fine on bluefin Sui... Everytime and crypto.com", "I actually had a trade stuck that even when I called Coinbase they could not release it.").

• **Uncertainty and fear of market manipulation**: Users express uncertainty and fear about the fairness of the market, feeling that exchanges like Coinbase may be manipulating prices to their advantage (e.g., "All the major exchanges were doing it", "I'm curious if you used post only or not to reduce fees because that can cause it to get rejected if price goes above order.").

• **Lack of support from customer service**: Users express frustration with the lack of effective support from Coinbase's customer service, feeling that their concerns are ignored or dismissed (e.g., "Have you ever had to deal with their customer service?... They will repeat to you for over an hour that they 'hear you and understand' but will do absolutely nothing to help you").
