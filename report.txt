=== Pain Points ===

Here are the main pain points mentioned by users, along with example quotes:

• **Lack of customization options**: "Every single lovable project looks the same. Same rounded cards, same placeholder icon in each card. Same thick borders. Same gradient overload. Same animations. Same page structure." - Minimum-Algae-4937

• **Unclear pricing and value proposition**: "I tried connecting Cursor to Supabase but it didn't seem to work as well. To note: I am using Cursor's agent through their browser, not locally through terminal. So that could be why I had issues with it." - noel_bass
• **Difficulty in understanding the competition**: "You should have checked your competition and their pricing" - Careless-inbar

• **High cost of Lovable**: "$25 a month at the lowest tier. But in the beginning I was running through credits really quickly because I was using it exclusively and struggling with its results." - noel_bass
• **Limited design implementation capabilities**: "I thought lovable had better design sense than cursor, but quickly moved to Cursor after ~1h on lovable" - Neat_Yogurtcloset_22

• **Complexity of Lovable's interface**: (Implicit, but not explicitly quoted)

• **Uncertainty about fees and pricing models**: "What is the justification for cb charging this much?" - 7venhigh
• **Difficulty in using Cursor with Supabase**: "I tried connecting Cursor to Supabase but it didn't seem to work as well." - noel_bass

• **Limited capabilities of Lovable's AI**: "Lovable cost $25 a month at the lowest tier. But in the beginning I was running through credits really quickly because I was using it exclusively and struggling with its results." - noel_bass
• **Difficulty in understanding which LLM model Lovable is using**: "How do you know which llm model lovable is using right now?" - ShadowsTagiru

• **Vibe coding not being understood by some users**: "Vibe coding isn’t web development. Hell to the no. Not by a fucking mile." - Minimum-Algae-4937
