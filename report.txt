===================================== Pain Points =====================================

The conversation appears to be about avoiding fees when withdrawing cryptocurrency from Coinbase. Here are some key points:

*   **Fees can add up quickly**: The fee for withdrawing USDT from Coinbase is $900, as mentioned in the thread.
*   **Using a cheaper chain**: Some users suggest moving the USDT to a cheaper chain like TRC20 first and then converting it to fiat through a trusted OTC service or Binance P2P.
*   **Gemini is an option**: Impressive-Rough6518 mentions Gemini as an exchange with lower fees, but this may not be suitable for everyone.
